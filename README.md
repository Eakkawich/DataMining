I use RapidMiner for compare results of algorithms (Decition Tree, Random Forest, Deep Learning, KNN, Naive Bayes).


Prediction the incident of persons who had an accident that drank alcohol.

I had coded for chose 2,926 data set from 214,951 dataset because more than 5,000 dataset in RapideMiner isn't free (paid for $5000 per year).
